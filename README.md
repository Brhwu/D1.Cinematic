My project satisfies the 8 key requirements as it has:

4 scenes,
2 audio assets,  
2 image assets,
3 geometric shapes,
1 logotype text,  (The title screen)
1 multi-line text block,  (the story)
3 fading scene transitions,
3 object motion animation.

For the 2 audio assets the first one (the wind) was made by sticking my headset mic infront of a fan and recording the noise.
For the second audio asset what I did was take the bonk sound effect from this link (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/bonk/)
and edited it in Audacity to have an increased pitch and reverb.

For the 2 image assets I drew them in Krita with the drawings partially based on the images from my Google Slides prototype.
